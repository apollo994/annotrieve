# Annotrieve

**Annotrieve** is a central hub for exploring and analyzing eukaryotic genome annotations. It aggregates GFF annotations weekly from **Ensembl**, **NCBI RefSeq**, and **NCBI GenBank**, giving you a single place to search, browse, compare, and download annotation data.

## What it does

- **Browse** annotations by taxon, organism, or assembly and view release timelines
- **Explore** statistics (genes, transcripts, pseudogenes, etc.) and compare assemblies side by side
- **Visualize** annotations in an embedded genome browser and navigate the taxonomic tree
- **Save** favorite annotations and filters for quick access
- **Download** metadata and gff files
