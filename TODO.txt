map annotations links from ncbi and ensembl ftp servers

DATA FLOW
    create annotation-tracker repo
        ensembl rr
        ensembl current_gff3
        ncbi all (Eukaryotes) 
        generate tsv files containing the paths to the annotations format: assembly_accession, full path

ncbi gca
ncbi gcf

ensembl current release
ensembl rapid release


possible models

GenomeAnnotation

    source: rapid_release, current_gff3, genbank, refseq
    db_source: ncbi or ensembl

Assembly as BGP
Taxon Node as BGP




STEPS:

download assemblies under EBP



    check if annotations from each 
    get annotations from ensembl and NCBI 
    
ENSEMBL RR JOB
    RETRIEVE PATHS
    CHECK IF PROCESSED ANNOTATIONS ALREADY EXISTS
    ADD NEW ANNOTATIONS
